# 🚧 DevOps Microservice Observability

This repository is a **work in progress** project focused on building a complete, automated, and intelligent **observability and automation platform** for cloud-native microservices using **n8n**, **MCP**, and modern **DevOps practices**.

The goal is to showcase how automation, monitoring, and AI-driven insights can work together to improve reliability, visibility, and efficiency in modern infrastructure.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

The project aims to:

- Deploy a **microservice-based application** on Kubernetes.
- Integrate **Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki** for observability.
- Automate **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions.
- Use **n8n** to orchestrate intelligent workflows (alerts, scaling, reporting).
- Connect **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for AI-based log and metric analysis.
- Provide insights and actions through **AI-assisted automation**.

When complete, this project will demonstrate a modern DevOps stack that merges **observability, automation, and intelligence** into a single operational workflow.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The system follows a modular architecture:

1. **Microservice Layer** – Containerized service exposing metrics and logs.
2. **Infrastructure Layer** – Provisioned using Terraform and Helm on AWS EKS.
3. **Observability Layer** – Prometheus scrapes metrics, Grafana visualizes, Loki collects logs.
4. **Automation Layer (n8n)** – Receives alerts and triggers automated actions.
5. **Intelligence Layer (MCP)** – Analyzes telemetry and suggests or executes improvements.

The result is an intelligent DevOps ecosystem that not only observes but also **acts** and **learns** from infrastructure behavior.
